# Multimodal AI Agent for Automated Medical Report Analysis

## Project Overview

This project leverages Multimodal AI Agents to analyze medical reports from various specialist perspectives, including cardiology, psychology, pulmonology, neurology, endocrinology, and immunology. Using LangChain, OpenAI's GPT models, and PyMuPDF, the system extracts insights from a PDF medical report, processes it through multiple AI-powered agents, and generates a comprehensive multidisciplinary diagnosis.

## Features
- Multimodal AI Agents for different medical specialties.
- Automated PDF medical report extraction using PyMuPDF.
- Parallel processing of multiple AI agents using ThreadPoolExecutor.
- Final diagnosis generation by a Multidisciplinary AI Agent.
- Structured output storage for easy reference.
